This directory contains the Python script developed for the implementation of metabolic networks using the libray NetworkX.
For this matter, it was established the class MetabolicNetwork with certain simple attributes with the exception of the attribute .G that consists on a oriented graph. This attribute allows the correct representation of a metabolical network as a graph.
Also, there are implemented several graph related functions for the defined class, such as shortest-path, eulerian circuit, among many others.
