This repository contains two different projects in the scope of my MSc course unit "Advanced Algorithms in Biofinformatics".

The R project contains the developed code for the differential analysis of some date collected from NGS regarding breast cancer.
The Python project consists on the implementation of a metabolic network using Python's library NetworkX as a directed graph from different types of files such as TXT, XML, GML, among others.

Both reports are in portuguese but these display the commands used, the essential code implemented and some graphic results.
